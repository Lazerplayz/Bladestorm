# Bladestorm

Bladestorm is a custom server core for NetherGames servers. Its primary purpose is to replace the old and messy NGCoreV2 server software in production use across all NetherGames servers. Bladestorm is aimed at reducing lag yet keeping up with new features of MCPE. Bladestorm is a fork of [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/pocketmine-mp)

### Notes

This server software is maintained by [@keithkfng](https://github.com/keithkfng) and [@Lazerplayz](https://github.com/lazerplayz) for NetherGames servers. This is not software for everyone, this is software for our intended use. Hopefully you find it useful too.
